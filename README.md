### Outline

This project's design is to help a client by web scraping data from several websites and show it on a web page. The data will be information, news and images of Mars. Splinter will be used to web scrape the websites then the data will be stored in a mongo database. Next the data will be displayed on a web page using flask.

## Results

### Deliverable 1: Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles 

In the module, the mars news from [redplanetscience.com](https://redplanetscience.com/), featured image from [spaceimages-mars.com](https://spaceimages-mars.com), and mars facts from [galaxyfacts-mars.com](https://galaxyfacts-mars.com) were scraped. In this project, the mars hemisphere images and titles from [marshemispheres.com](https://marshemispheres.com) were scraped. 

### Deliverable 2:  Update the Web App with Marsâ€™s Hemisphere Images and Titles

In the module, scraping.py was created to store the code for scraping the websites from deliverable 1. scraping.py has a function for each web scrape and combines it into one function scrape_all. This scrape_all function was added to the app.py to run the website using flask. This project has index.html with a div that holds the images, and text scraped from the web scrape. Then the flask app was run and data was shown on the localhost web page.  

### Deliverable 3: Add Bootstrap 3 Components

This project stylized the web page using Bootstrap 3 and CSS classes. For example, the mars facts is a table with table-hover class and the mars hemispheres were put side by side using 
```
class = 'col-md-3'
```

## Summary

### Conclusion

The project successfully displays the mars information, news and images that the client wanted on a web page.

### Usage
